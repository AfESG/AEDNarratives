## Current Issues

Elephants in Benin are now almost completely confined to the northern border region adjoining Burkina Faso and Niger. The group of protected areas in this region are known collectively as the WAP complex (Parc W, Arly National Park and Pendjari National Park), with Pendjari NP, Parc W du Benin and hunting zones within Benin. 

The relatively high density of elephants in Pendjari NP has had an impact on the vegetation including baobab trees and borassus palms [(Salako et al., 2016)](/references#s).

Benin’s national strategy for elephant conservation was developed and published in 2005 [(Ministère de l’Agriculture, de l’Elevage et de la Pêche, 2005)](/references#m).

## Numbers and Distribution

The estimated number of elephants in areas surveyed in the last ten years in Benin is 2,984 ± 1,460 at the time of the last survey for each area. This estimate applies to 9,122 km², which is all of the estimated known and possible elephant range.

There has been an increase in recorded estimates at a national level, although this increase results from comparison of surveys using different techniques, so may not represent a true increase in numbers. 

An **aerial sample count** conducted in the Benin, Burkina Faso, and Niger WAP complex in 2015 [(Bouché et al., 2015)](/references#b), showed the main elephant concentrations in Benin to be in the Pendjari NP, in Parc W and in the Mekrou Hunting Zone. The estimate for Pendjari NP was 1,632 ± 1,394, which replaces an estimate of 788 from a total count conducted in 2003 [(Bouché et al., 2004)](/references#b). No elephants were seen in the central part of Pendjari NP, with most elephants occurring along the border with Burkina Faso. The estimate for Parc W du Benin NP in 2015 was 462 ± 174, compared to 56 from the 2003 total count [(Bouché et al., 2004b)](/references#b). The estimate for the Konkombri Hunting Zone was 87 ± 87 in 2015, with Mekrou Hunting Zone having an estimate of 803 ± 390 in the same survey. In the AESR 2007 these areas were combined as Atakora, and there was a 2003 total count of 343 [(Bouché et al., 2004b)](/references#b).  On the basis of the 2015 survey, two areas of **doubtful range** have been changed to **known range**.

An aerial total count of parts of Parc W du Benin NP and the Djona Hunting Zone was also carried out in 2012 [(Bouché, 2012a)](/references#b) and a foot survey of Parc W, Pendjari NP and adjoining hunting zones was carried out in 2013 [(Bouché et al., 2013a)](/references#b). However, since these surveys did not cover the entirety of any protected areas, it is not possible to use their results for comparative purposes.

The 2003 and 2015 surveys used different techniques and were not directly comparable but there was a striking increase in estimates. It cannot be explained by movements from the other two WAP countries, since the estimate for the entire area, including the other countries, increased from 4,592 in 2003 to 8,953 ± 1,253 in 2015.  There seems to have been little opportunity for elephants to have been compressed into these protected areas from other parts of the range, since there were not thought to be significant numbers outside the WAP complex even in 2003. It has been suggested that the population may have increased after 2003 but declined in recent years, as indicated by the high carcass ratio of 10% recorded across the WAP complex [(Bouché et al., 2015)](/references#b). However it is also possible that the 2003 result was an underestimate, or that 2015 was an overestimate, or both.

According to Bouché [(pers. comm., 2015)](/references#p) it is unlikely that any elephants remain in the forests of Alibori Supérieur, Goungoun and Trois Rivières and they have been changed to **doubtful range**. Another area to the north of the Djona Hunting Zone has also been changed to **doubtful range** [(Bouché, pers. comm., 2015)](/references#b).
