## Current Issues

Swaziland has only two small fenced populations of elephants and concerns have been raised about their impact on the biodiversity of these areas. In 2016, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service approved an application to import 18 African elephants from Swaziland to three zoos in the United States. In March 2016 the elephants were flown to the US despite a pending legal challenge to block the importation (Peters, 2016)

There is no current or past action plan or strategy for the management of African elephants in Swaziland.

## Numbers and Distribution

The estimated number of elephants in areas surveyed in the last ten years in Swaziland is 42 at the time of the last survey for each area. This number applies to 50 km², which is 100% of the estimated known and possible elephant range in Swaziland.

Elephant distribution is well known in Swaziland, being mainly restricted to fenced enclosures within Hlane Royal National Park and Mkhaya Game Reserve. The enclosures only occupy a fraction of the reserves (6% and 19% respectively). **Individual registration** of all elephants is maintained for the Hlane Royal NP and Mkhaya GR populations. There were 25 elephants in Hlane in 2015 compared to 13 in 2005, and 14 in Mkhaya in 2015 compared to 15 in 2005 (Reilly, pers. comm., 2016).

Three elephants originating from the Songimvelo Game Reserve in South Africa are regularly seen in the Mololotja Nature Reserve in north-western Swaziland (Reilly, pers. comm., 2012). During 2014, two elephants, a cow and a sub-adult crossed from Mozambique into Swaziland at Lomahasha. Over a period of three days they traveled across Hlane Royal NP and west to the escarpment, west of eBuhleni, traversing communal areas. They then returned along a similar route, crossing Hlane Royal NP and Mlawula Nature Reserve, returning to Mozambique via the Umbuluzi river gorge (Reilly, pers. comm., 2016).
