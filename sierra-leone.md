## Current Issues

There is little information about the current status of the few elephants remaining in Sierra Leone, and it is believed that the civil war of 1991-2001 had a severe impact on them (Lindsell et al., 2011).  Agence Presse Francaise (AFP, 2009) reported in November 2009 that the last elephants in Sierra Leone had been wiped out by poaching. This report has been widely circulated and repeated in news items as recently as 2013. This was not correct; several small populations still survive, although they are under pressure from poaching, mining and logging (Ballweg et al., 2013).

The Gola East Forest Reserve population has been recorded as lost. 

Sierra Leone published an elephant conservation plan in 1991, although this is now out of date (Ministry of Agriculture, 1991).

## Numbers and Distribution

There have been no surveys carried out in Sierra Leone in the last ten years to the standards required for generating an estimate. There may be 135 to 155 elephants in areas not systematically surveyed in Sierra Leone. These guesses likely represent a minimum number, and actual numbers could be higher than those reported. These guesses apply to 867 km², which is 64% of the estimated known and possible elephant range. There remains an additional 36% of the estimated range for which no elephant population estimates are available.

There has been a reduction in the guessed number of elephants in Sierra Leone because of the loss of the Gola East elephant population.

There are four areas within Sierra Leone where it is believed that elephants still occur. These are Gola North Forest, Outamba Kilimi National Park, Bagbe River Forest and the Kangari Hills Forest Reserve (Ballweg et al., 2013; Siaka, pers. comm., 2016). These are marked as **known range**, while the Nimini South Forest Reserve, from which there are no recent records, has been changed to **doubtful range**, as has a small unnamed area of range from the AESR 2007 in the north-east corner of the country. The Gola East Forest Reserve population is now presumed extinct, a conclusion confirmed by local hunters who had not seen elephants there since the war (Lindsell et al., 2011), and this has been recorded as a **lost population**.

A dung survey was carried out in Outamba Kilimi National Park in 2012 (Ballweg et al., 2013). Elephants were only found in the western part of the Outamba section of the park, and there was insufficient data to derive a population estimate. Illegal gold mining was said to be an increasing problem. Since no new estimate was given, the estimate of 80-100 from 2006 (Danquah & Nandjui, pers. comm., 2006) has been retained.

Lindsell et al. (2011) carried out biodiversity surveys in the Gola Forest Complex in 2006-2007. This area was believed to have been badly affected by the civil war, and it was confirmed that elephant numbers had declined. However, in the absence of new information on numbers, the guess of 50 elephants from 1987 (Grubb et al., 1998) has been retained. The elephants in Gola North may not be permanently resident in this area but move back and forth across the Moro River between Sierra Leone and Liberia. The distribution of elephants in Gola North has been clarified with records from camera traps, direct observations and elephant signs from 2008 to 2014 (Tubbs, pers. comm., 2015).
