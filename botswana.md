## Current Issues

Botswana has by far the largest elephant population of any country in Africa. The vast majority occur in the north of Botswana within the Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area (KAZA TFCA), shared by Botswana, Namibia, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Angola, and elephants move between these countries. 

Poaching of elephants by armed gangs has become an increasing threat in northern Botswana. Anti-poaching is undertaken by the Department of Wildlife and National Parks (DWNP), the Botswana Defence Force (BDF) and the Botswana Police (KAZA Secretariat, 2014a).  DWNP has recently produced an approved National Anti-Poaching Strategy (Blackbeard, pers. comm., 2014).

The National Policy and Strategy for the Conservation and Management of the African Elephant was published in 2003 (DG Ecological Consulting, 2003). It is now outdated and in need of revision.

In 2008, Botswana undertook an approved one-off sale of 43,153 kg of ivory to Japan and China, at a total price of USD $7,093,551 (Wijnstekers, 2011).

Botswana declared an export quota of 600 tusks and other hunting trophies in 2007. The annual export quota for tusks and other hunting trophies fluctuated from 600 to 800 between 2009 and 2014. However, in 2014 a ban was placed on trophy hunting in the country and in 2015 a zero quota for exports of elephant hunting trophies was declared (CITES, n.d.-a).

## Numbers and Distribution

The estimated number of elephants in areas surveyed in the last ten years in Botswana is 131,626 ± 12,508 at the time of the last survey for each area. This estimate applies to 128,856 km², which is 57% of the estimated known and possible elephant range. There remains an additional 43% of the estimated known and possible elephant range for which no elephant population estimates are available. 

The movement of elephants between northern Botswana and neighbouring countries requires that coordinated, simultaneous surveys are conducted to avoid the possibility of double counting or of missing animals entirely (KAZA Secretariat, 2014b). Counts flown of contiguous range in neighbouring countries were not synchronized with the 2014 Botswana survey.

The Botswana elephant population appeared to increase substantially from about 50,000 in 1990 to over 150,000 in 2006. However, this increase has been disputed (Junker et al., 2008). The estimate used in the AESR 2007 was the previously accepted national total of 154,658 ± 21,253 (Department of Wildlife and National Parks, 2006). More recent surveys have provided incompatible results. In 2010 and 2014 **aerial sample counts** of northern Botswana were undertaken by Elephants without Borders (Chase et al., 2015; Songhurst & Chase, 2010) and in 2012 and 2013 surveys were conducted by DWNP (DWNP, 2012). Results from the 2013 survey have not been released. The other surveys gave estimates of 128,340 ± 9,938 (2010), 207,545 ± 21,771 (2012) and 129,939 ± 12,501 (2014). These differences are so great that they are more likely to result from differences in survey technique or calculations rather than real population change or elephant movements.

Although a new total of 129,939 ± 12,501 from the Great Elephant Census in 2014 (Chase et al., 2015) has been included in the AED, this result raises questions with respect to the 2010 and 2012 surveys. It indicates no significant change since 2010 although a population that shows no evidence of serious poaching, excessive natural mortality or high levels of net emigration would be expected to show some increase.  Compared to the 2012 survey results, the 2014 estimate would indicate a marked decline that is unlikely in the absence of any other indicators. Given that the KAZA TFCA transboundary population is the largest elephant population in Africa, of which the majority is within Botswana, it remains of the highest priority to carry out a simultaneous and coordinated count of the entire population. 

The 2014 survey report gave a carcass ratio of 7% for northern Botswana (Chase et al., 2015), which is not considered exceptionally high, as carcass ratios of up to 8% are considered typical of a stable or increasing elephant population (Douglas-Hamilton & Burrill, 1991). However, it shows a notable increase over the earlier carcass ratio of 2% in 2010 and 2012.  

Botswana is one of the few countries in Africa with confirmed elephant range expansion for elephants. In recent years the range has increased to the west towards Namibia (Songhurst, pers. comm. 2016) as well as southwards with large herds sighted for the first time in the Central Kalahari Game Reserve (CKGR) (Mokhandla, pers. comm., 2016). The 2015 dry season **aerial sample count** in Ghanzi District estimated 797 ± 437 (DWNP, 2016) of which 411 ± 252 were in CKGR. This is the first time that elephants have been counted in this area. 

There is a population estimated at 890 elephants from an **aerial total count** in 2014 in the Tuli Block in the extreme eastern part of the country (Selier & Page, 2015). This is part of a larger transboundary population in the Greater Mapungubwe Transfrontier Conservation Area that includes South Africa and Zimbabwe. This replaces an estimate of 1,038 ± 685 (Department of Wildlife and National Parks, 2006).
