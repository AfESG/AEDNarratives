## Current Issues

Côte d’Ivoire has suffered from civil unrest and violence in recent years, and this has affected conservation efforts. The civil war, which started in 2002, split the country between the rebel-held north and the government-controlled south. A power-sharing deal in 2007 presented the prospect of peace, but a 2010 presidential poll led to further violence (International Crisis Group, 2011). This lack of stability has meant that little attention has been paid to conservation and protected areas (Koné, 2013). Wildlife in protected areas is threatened by hunting, the encroachment of cocoa plantations on protected area boundaries in the forest zone, and expansion of illegal cocoa farming within parks and reserves (Bitty et al., 2015). 

Most of Côte d’Ivoire’s elephant population is found in small fragments of forest. Some of these populations have survived for a surprisingly long time, but there are many for which there is no recent information, and a number of these are likely to have disappeared. There is only one forest population in Taï National Park which is estimated to have more than a hundred elephants, and the status of elephants in Comoé National Park, the country’s largest protected area, is unclear. 

Following the invasion of Marahoué National Park by people fleeing post-election violence in 2010-11, 12 elephants moved into farming areas near the city of Daloa and were responsible for the deaths of three people. As a result, four male elephants were translocated from Daloa to Azagny National Park on the coast in January 2014, and a further two died during the exercise (McPherson, 2014). The population of Marahoué NP is now recorded as lost, having previously been one of the country’s largest elephant populations. 

Côte d’Ivoire published its national strategy for elephant management in 2004, covering a time period from 2005 to 2014 (Ministère des Eaux et Forêts, 2004).

## Numbers and Distribution

The estimated number of elephants in areas surveyed in the last ten years in Côte d'Ivoire is 189 ± 135 at the time of the last survey for each area. There may be an additional 647 to 652 elephants in areas not systematically surveyed. These guesses likely represent a minimum number, and actual numbers could be higher than those reported. Together, this estimate and guess apply to 13,334 km², which is 92% of the estimated known and possible elephant range. There remains an additional 8% of the estimated range for which no elephant population estimates are available.

There has been almost no change in the population estimates, because an apparent increase in numbers in Taï NP from a survey using a different technique is matched by the loss of the Marahoué NP population. Total guesses have been reduced, mostly as a result of populations being lost.  

Taï NP in the southwest, close to the Liberian border, holds what is probably the largest remaining elephant population in the country. A **dung count** conducted there in 2010 gave an estimate of 189 (54-324) elephants (Baofo & Nandjui, 2011). This replaces an estimate of 53 ± 26 from a DNA survey (Eggert, 2004b).

Comoé NP, which lies in the northern savanna zone, is the largest protected area in the country. An aerial sample count of the park and some surrounding areas was carried out in 2010 (N’Goran et al., 2010). Although some signs were seen from the air, no actual elephants were observed. However, the sampling intensity was low, and elephants are thought to concentrate in gallery forests where they would be difficult to see from an aircraft. A researcher who worked in Comoé NP between 2014 and 2015 estimated at least 100 elephants in the park (Lapuente, pers. comm., 2016), concentrated in the west close to the Komoé river, and this **informed guess** replaces an informed guess of 10-20 elephants from 2002 (Fischer, 2005). There were also at least another 20 elephants in the neighbouring areas of Mont Tingui and Kinkené (Lapuente, pers. comm., 2016). The area in the east of the park has been changed to **doubtful** range, as has the area between Comoé NP and the Burkina Faso border. 

Most other estimates remain unchanged from the AESR 2007 report but many are now more than ten years old, and have therefore become degraded data. Continued records of crop-raiding indicate that elephants remain widespread, albeit in small numbers. An **informed guess** of 15-20 for the Beki Bossematié Classified Forest from 2013 (Lapuente, pers. comm., 2016) replaces a guess of 35 from 1993 (Theuerkauf et al., 2001). A **guess** of two elephants in Mont Sangbé National Park in 2013 (Lapuente, pers. comm., 2016) replaces a guess of 47 (Lauginie et al., 2001). There were still elephants in Mont Péko in 2012 (Sissler-Beinvenu, pers. comm., 2016), but probably fewer than the guess of 40 from 2000 (Kobon, pers. comm., 2002) which has not been replaced because this confirmation of presence did not include an estimate of new numbers. 

The elephant population of Marahoué NP, which had an estimate of 159 ± 53 from a genetic dung count in 2002 (Eggert, 2004a), was lost in about 2010 after the park was almost completely settled by local people. In early 2013, no evidence of elephants  was found in a survey covering 506 km of transects (Sissler-Beinvenu, pers. comm., 2016). Marahoué NP has been changed to **doubtful range**. Since it is not clear whether all the elephants from neighbouring Daloa were translocated, this has been added as a point record, where an unknown number of elephants may remain.

Prior to the translocation of elephants from Daloa, there were almost no elephants left in Azagny NP. Whereas there had been an estimate of 65-117 in 2003 (Nandjui, 2003) no evidence of human-elephant conflict was found on the periphery of the park for the two years prior to 2013 and only a few signs of the presence of elephants inside the park. Local hunters said that there were only three surviving elephants, compared to 9-10 in 2010 (Sissler-Beinvenu, pers. comm., 2016). 

Crop raiding has been reported from three widely separated sites in the south of the country and these have been added as point records (Bakayoko, 2015; Kan, 2015; La Dépêche d’Abidjan, 2015).
