## Current Issues

Ongoing political instability in Somalia has made conservation assessment work impossible for over 25 years, and it is not known whether there is still a resident elephant population in the country.

It has been suggested that the Al-Shabaab insurgents derive much of their income from the illegal ivory trade. However, a detailed review in 2015 indicated that any Al-Shabaab involvement in the ivory trade is likely to have been opportunistic, ad hoc and small-scale (Maguire & Haenlein, 2015). Ivory was reported to be openly for sale in Mogadishu in 2015 (Amir, pers. comm., 2016).

Somalia published an elephant conservation plan in 1991 (National Range Agency, 1991) and it has not been updated since.

## Numbers and Distribution

It is unknown whether there is still a resident elephant population in Somalia. There may be 70 elephants in areas not systematically surveyed. This guess applies to 3,089 km², which is 68% of the estimated known and possible elephant range. There remains an additional 32% of the estimated range for which no elephant population estimates are available.

There is only one area, in the far south of the country and adjacent to the border with Kenya, which remains categorised as possible range while the Juba and Webi Shabeelli valleys remain as doubtful range. 

The only estimate remaining, for Lag Badana-Bushbush (Bauer, pers. comm., 1995), has already been degraded to the category of ‘other guess’. Local residents reported in 2016 that elephants were regular visitors to the area, but not resident (Amir et al., 2016). A collared elephant from Kenya moved briefly into the border regions of Somali in 2016 (Douglas-Hamilton, pers. comm., 2016a). Press reports in 2015 suggested that security operations in the Boni-Dodori area of Kenya had driven elephants north into Somalia (Mohamed, 2015).
