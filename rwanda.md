## Current Issues

Rwanda is one of Africa’s smallest and most densely populated nations and there is little space for wildlife. Only two fragments of elephant range remain: the Akagera National Park on the north-eastern border with Tanzania, to which elephants were translocated in the mid-1970s, and the Volcans National Park on the northern border with the DRC. In 2010, the African Parks Network took over responsibility for the management of Akagera NP (Sullivan, 2014)

Rwanda published an elephant conservation plan in 1991, although this is now 25 years out of date (Office Rwandais du Tourisme et des Parcs Nationaux, 1991).

## Numbers and Distribution

The estimated number of elephants in areas surveyed in the last ten years and at the time of the last survey in Rwanda is 88. There may be an additional 37 elephants in an area not systematically surveyed. This guess likely represents a minimum number, and actual numbers could be higher than those reported. Together, this estimate and guess apply to 1,079 km², which is the entirety of the estimated known and possible elephant range. 

There have been minor changes in elephant population estimates in Rwanda since AESR 2007. The Akagera population appears to be stable or increasing, although survey methodologies have not been consistent.

After the elephant population of Akagera NP in eastern Rwanda was eliminated in the early 1960s, 22 elephants were translocated to Akagera NP from Bugusera, south of Kigali (Van de Weghe, 1990). The number of elephants subsequently increased, despite a reduction in the size of the park. The most recent survey, an **aerial total count** carried out in 2013 (Macpherson, 2013a), provided an estimate of 88 individuals. This replaces a guess of 34-80 from 2002 based on an aerial sample count (Lamprey, 2002). A sample count in 2010 gave an estimate of 27 individuals (Viljoen, 2010). A dung count was also conducted in 2006 (Parker, 2006); the elephant population estimate for the lakeside stratum was 28 (17-45). Due to a low dung encounter rate, it was not possible to calculate dung density and elephant numbers for the highland stratum. Elephants used to move between Akagera and Ibanda, Burigi and Biharamulo in Tanzania, but their passage was restricted by high levels of refugee settlement on the Tanzanian side starting in the mid-1990s (TAWIRI, 2015c) and it is unlikely that such movements continue.

The estimate of 37 for the Volcans NP has been retained (Gray, pers. comm., 2005) but degraded due to age. The range has been left as known because of recent reports that there are still elephants (Kanyesigye, 2013), and confirmed records just across the border in Virunga NP in DRC.
