## Current Issues

Apart from the large population of elephants in the Kruger National Park, most of South Africa’s elephant populations exist in relatively small fenced areas (Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism, 2008), many of which are privately owned. In some places, local elephant overabundance has led to adverse impacts on other biodiversity and a number of management approaches have been undertaken. These include the use of immuno-contraception to control reproduction (Delsink et al., 2013).

Until 2008, there was little elephant poaching in South Africa. However this has recently changed, with increased poaching for ivory, particularly in Kruger National Park (AFP, 2014).

South Africa published a set of Norms and Standards for Managing African Elephants in 2008 (Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism, 2008) and these were under review in 2014 (Department of Environmental Affairs, 2014). 

In 2008, South Africa undertook an approved one-off sale of 47,346 kg of ivory to Japan and China, at a price of USD $6,702,695 (Wijnstekers, 2011). Trophy hunting of elephants is legal in South Africa, and from 2007 to 2015, the declared annual quota increased from 200 tusks as hunting trophies (from 100 animals) to 300 (CITES, n.d.-b). 

In recent analyses of seizure data in ETIS, prepared for CITES, South Africa has been identified as a country with a worrying involvement in illegal ivory trade (Milliken et al., 2013, 2016).

## Numbers and Distribution

The estimated number of elephants in areas surveyed in the last ten years in South Africa is 18,841 at the time of the last survey for each area. There may be an additional 8,425 to 8,435 elephants in areas not systematically surveyed. These guesses likely represent a minimum number, and actual numbers could be higher than those reported. Together, this estimate and guess apply to 28,203 km², which is 92% of the known and possible elephant range. There remains an additional 8% of the estimated range for which no population estimates are available.

There has been a reported increase of about 1,000 elephants in the form of estimates, and about 8,000 in guesses since the AESR 2007. While the major population in Kruger NP has increased substantially, the quality of information for other areas is lower than in the AESR 2007, and many areas that previously had documented surveys now have unsupported population figures, which means that elephant numbers are recorded as guesses. 

South Africa’s elephants are confined to protected areas, private reserves and other privately-owned properties, largely in the north and east of the country, though some populations remain – or are being newly established – in the far south. The largest population of elephants is found within and around Kruger NP, from where most of the elephants in other populations have been translocated. 

Following implementation of a policy of managing landscapes rather than managing elephants, and the cessation of culling in 1994, the elephant population of Kruger NP has increased. Annual total counts were carried out until 2012, followed by an **aerial total count** in 2015 which gave an estimate of 17,086 (Ferreira et al., 2015). This replaces a count of 12,427 from 2006 (Whyte, 2007). Since 2003 the growth rate has slowed to 4.2% and this may be connected to the closure of artificial water sources in the park (Ferreira et al., 2015). Fences between Kruger and many neighboring private reserves have been removed, allowing free movement of elephants. However, there is no figure for the entire Kruger ecosystem, since one major private reserve has asked for its numbers to be aggregated with private reserves in other parts of the country (Garaï, pers. comm., 2016). Elephants from Kruger NP move into adjacent areas of Mozambique, especially the adjoining Limpopo National Park. One radio-collared elephant from northern Kruger moved through Mozambique as far as Gonarezhou National Park in Zimbabwe (Henley, 2011).

The population at Addo Elephant National Park has increased slightly, with an overall count of 595 in 2012 (Ferreira et al., 2012), replacing one of 459 in 2005.

In Eastern Cape province there are two elephants in Knysna and two in the Great Fish River Provincial Reserve (Selier, pers. comm., 2016). In KwaZulu Natal, Hluhluwe-Imfolozi Game Reserve has 700 elephants, Ithala Game Reserve has 162, uMkhuze Game Reserve has 90 and Tembe Elephant Reserve, linked via the Futi Corridor to Maputo Special Reserve in Mozambique, supports at least 220 elephants (EKZNW, 2016).  The St Lucia Reserves have 110 elephants (EKZNW, 2016). These are all **informed guesses** and reflect increased numbers compared to earlier estimates, with the exception of Hluhluwe GR from where elephants have been translocated (EKZNW, 2016).

In Mpumalanga Province, there are 57 elephants in the Mthetomusha Provincial Reserve and 105 in Songimvelo Game Reserve (Garaï, pers. comm., 2016); these are both **informed guesses** and represent increases on previous estimates. 

In North West Province both Madikwe Provincial Nature Reserve (1,006 elephants) and Pilanesberg Provincial Nature Reserve (240 elephants) show increases based on **informed guesses** (Garaï, pers. comm., 2016). In Limpopo Province **informed guesses** indicate that Atherstone Provincial Nature Reserve holds 105 elephants, Letaba Provincial Nature Reserve 621, Makuya Provincial Nature Reserve nine (Garaï, pers. comm., 2016), and Manyeleti Game Reserve 222 (SANParks, 2009). Marakele National Park has 171 elephants (Ferreira et al., 2012).  

As part of a total count survey of the Greater Mapungubwe Transfrontier Conservation Area (Selier & Page, 2015), 347 elephants were counted in Mapungubwe National Park and three in the surrounding area. 

Information on elephants in private reserves and other privately-owned elephant properties has been obtained from the Elephant Management and Owners Association (Garaï, pers. comm., 2016). At the request of their owners, some private reserves are grouped under one overall estimate and are not shown on the map. This **guess** totals 2,482 elephants. Other private nature reserves for which numbers are available are Maremani (64), Kwandwe (57), Kariega (41) and Balule, Timbavati, Umbabat and Klaserie combined (2,772).
