## Current Issues

Only one elephant population is known to occur in Niger, forming part of the WAP transfrontier population. It is possible that elephants also occur on the Nigerian border, but there is no recent information. 

Niger published a strategy and action plan for the sustainable management of elephants in 2010 (Direction de la Faune, de la Chasse et des Aires Protégées, 2010).

## Numbers and Distribution

There is a zero estimate for the only survey carried out in Niger in the last ten years to the standards required for generating an estimate. There may be 17 elephants in areas not systematically surveyed. This number applies to 2,333 km², which is all of the estimated known and possible elephant range in Niger. 

The reduction in the estimated national population since the AESR 2007 is a result of no elephants being seen in the aerial sample count of the WAP complex in 2015, but it is possible that more elephants do come into Niger on occasion. 

Parc W du Niger National Park is located in the southwest region of the country and is part of the WAP transfrontier complex. An **aerial sample count** of the complex was carried out in 2015, but no elephants were seen within the Niger portion of Parc W du Niger NP (Bouché et al., 2015). This is likely to be a result of sampling error or a consequence of a small number of elephants moving between countries rather than loss of the population, since a total aerial count conducted in 2012 gave a count of 136 elephants within the park and three outside (Bouché, 2012a). Additionally, a ground count in 2013 gave an estimate of 380 ± 61 (Bouché et al., 2013a).   

The second, much smaller, population used to occur in the northern part of the Babban Rafi forest, which extends into Nigeria (Direction de la Faune, 1991). There is no recent information on these elephants so the estimate of 17 elephants (Issa, pers. comm., 2005) has been retained but degraded. The range has been changed to **doubtful range** in view of the lack of recent information.
